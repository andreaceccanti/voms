summary: Several fixes and improvements for VOMS Admin server
---

This release provides an update for VOMS Admin server.

[VOMS Admin server 3.4.0][rn-admin] provides several features and improvements,
mainly targeted at the CERN VOMS deployment. The highlights are:

- the CERN HR member id is used instead of the primary email address for
  linking VOMS and CERN HR membership

- an improved request handling page that allows to handle multiple requests with a
  single click

- all actions performed are now saved in a persistent audit log in the voms
  database; this audit log replaces the limited request log available in former
  voms-admin releases

- VOMS admin now requires Java 8

- The [VOMS Admin guide][voms-admin-guide] has been split in two documents:
  - The [VOMS Admin user guide][voms-admin-user-guide], targeted at VO members and applicants
  - The [VOMS Admin VO administrator guide][voms-admin-vo-admin-guide], targeted at VO administrators

For more details and the complete list of changes and new features, see the
[release notes][rn-admin].

As usual packages can be obtained from our repositories and will soon be pushed
to the EMI-3 and UMD repositories. For instructions, refer to  the [releases
section][releases].
