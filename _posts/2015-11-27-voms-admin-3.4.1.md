summary: A fix for subject-based authentication in VOMS Admin server
---

This release provides an update for VOMS Admin server.

With default settings, VOMS Admin authenticates clients by looking
at the client certificate (subject,issuer) couple.

A configuration flag was introduced in VOMS Admin 3.3.2 to authenticate only on
subject, but the fix worked only for VO administrators.

[VOMS Admin server 3.4.1][rn-admin] provides a fix for the above problem.

As usual packages can be obtained from our repositories and will soon be pushed
to the EMI-3 and UMD repositories. For instructions, refer to  the [releases
section][releases].
