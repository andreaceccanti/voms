and documentation for all VOMS components.

The web site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). 
The data for the web site is in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/italiangrid/voms/tree/gh-pages) branch of the voms repo. 
People willing to contribute, for example improving the documentation, can fork the repo and submit a pull request.
